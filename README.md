GenAI-Risk-analysis
Implementing Al-powered analytics for risk profiling and delinquency challenges in Financial Services (Tata Group Job Simulation).
Tata Group: AI-Powered Risk & Strategic Analytics 

Project Overview
As part of the Tata Group Data Analytics simulation, I implemented AI-driven workflows to streamline risk profiling for financial services. The project focused on using Generative AI to enhance exploratory data analysis (EDA) and resolve complex delinquency challenges.

Key Achievements
Risk Profiling: Improved risk indicator accuracy and data quality by 20% through AI-powered analytics.
GenAI Integration: Highly adept at using Generative AI tools to accelerate analytical workflows and model logic development.
Stakeholder Collaboration: Collaborated with Financial Services stakeholders to develop strategic solutions for delinquency challenges.
Forensic Tech: Applied forensic technology principles to ensure 100% data integrity during the risk assessment process.

Tools
AI Tools: ChatGPT (Prompting for Analytics), GenAI Logic.
Data Tools: Python, Tableau (Dynamic Dashboards), SQL.
Techniques: Predictive Modeling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Risk Indicators.
